  * Enhance your greeting features. 
    * Use at least one third-party npm library, example: add icon/art/emoji greeting
    * Add at least one new option to the greet function
  * Automated build and development environent via npm scripts
  * changelog and semver "history":
    * the version from the previous lab is `v1.0.0`
    * break the work above into _at least_ 3 "releases"
    * Properly increment the semver according to the change in each "release"

The package.json file should include:
  * all the dependencies and dev devdependencies for the project.

The npm scripts should address:
